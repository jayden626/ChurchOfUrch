				I have 2 years industry experience as a Full-Stack Java Developer.
				I've worked in solo and team environments, as well as a project manager / team lead.
				I'm looking to focus on scalable backend services (APIs, AWS, SaaS) and am searching for a position which will challenge and drive my growth in the field.

            <p>
			   I love to travel, having spent 6 months in Arizona during my studies and 2 years in Canada snowboarding and hiking.
			   I am a self-managed go-getter and wish to continue exploring the great outdoors experiencing all that I can, working remotely to continue my career as I go.
